Mrs Gail Smith;

Is 33 years old and lives in Newport, married to John, and has 2 kids, a boy and a girl.

Although mindful of the kids future and the legacy of what they will grow up into, Gail feels that she cannot single handedly change the world.

Each day, Gail jumps into her car and drives 6 km to work in the outer North West of the Melbourne CBD, whilst driving morning she hear on the radio of a new website devoted to helping the environment called "itCounts", an initiative of the General Assembly group as a community service.
The idea being that many people feel overwhelmed by the information overload, the massive tasks that are required to preserve our environment.

This app shows that each persons little action, totaled together can in fact make a difference, ItCounts, shows us how this can be achieved.

Public Individual;

This app/website is designed to bring people together over the digital porthole, and give a sense of community in trying to improve the planet.
Each person can contribute by registering themselves and making little savings, that bundled together can make a huge impact to the environment.

-	WATER;
	For example reducing your shower time by 1 minute can up upwards of 8 litres of water per shower, thats just one person per day. Now trun that figure into 500 people pre day reducing their shower time by 1 minute equates to 4000 litres of water per day, 28,000 litres per week, 120,000 litres per month, 1,460,000 litres per year!
	Thats enought to fill 30% of an olympic size pool, with 500 people saving water.......
	Now equate that if 1000 people did this, or even 2000 people did this??

-	Reduce Carbon;
	Well for starters leave the car at home!
	-	Benefits to your health, lots of excercise, reduces fatigue, great for glutes etc.

	-	Reduced your weekly expenditure, less fuel, wear & tear, parking. But it also reduces 90% of the current greenhouse emissions being poured into the environment.
	-	Catch public transport, walk to the bustop, train station, tram stop, and let someone else drive you to work.

-	Recycle;
		If you own an ipad, PC, laptop or even an iphone did you know that most newspapers have a digital edition full of color photos, interactive newsstories, updated peridically during thet day?
		The cost are the same, if not less for some editions, and can save you money, this goes the same for your favourite magazines. Magazines can be pruchased online for up to 75% less than what you pay in a newsagents. 
		Each tonne of paper recycled, or not used can save up to 13 trees. 

-	Power;
		Simple, switch of lights in rooms not being used, put sensor lights into the garage, on the patio, even in utility rooms, to ensure
		lights dont get accidently left on.
		Switch old light globes to LED, and save money over the life of the globe. Switch appliances off at tyhe switch, do you really need that standby light left on??

So come on, above are some basic principles to live by, and you can see in live time, how many more people are doing exactly the same, be part of the digital community, saving the planet for future use, we are only the current custodial owners, we need to leave it to the next generation the way we found it, if not better.

As a workgroup, the "Payroll" section who as a group have saved 100 litres of water per day, up against the staff from "HR", who only managed to save 80litres per day can develop some friendly competitive banter, keeping them engaged as a group, which then extends to how they work together in more serious work situations.

	Tallys of goals achieved, numbers saved and then even posted at the end of each week, or month can be beneficial to being engaged as a group.
